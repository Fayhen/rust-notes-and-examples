# rust-notes-and-examples
Personal notes and examples on the Rust language

This repository contains several code examples made by me, while learning the Rust programming language. Most were derived from reading "the book", [The Rust Programming Language]<https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html>, together with related documentation.

Source codes contain explanatory comments. Programs can be executed using [Cargo]<https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo>, simply by navigating to their root directory in your terminal and executing `cargo run`. No built binaries were included in this repository.
